# The Culprits of flight delays -What causes flight delays

Flight delays have been increasingly under the public scrutiny and have long been the focus of researchers in different areas.
In this project, we try to find some of the most relevant causes of flight delays and utilized those factors to predict future 
flight delays by using airline data from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). Furthermore, by building a accurate
prediction model for flight delays, there is a great business potential that we can find solutions to prevent flight delays.

### Prerequisites

Some packages are required for this project
